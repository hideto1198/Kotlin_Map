# Kotlin_Map
This app is shown how to use Google map in Kotlin by easily!
This is so simply, and **does not use Google Map Activity**.
Why does not use that? Because has no extensibility. (probably)
You make Google Map's <fragment> by own hands makes you usefully. You can use that anywhere. That's so great! You think so to!
please free use!

when you use my app,You must change API_KEY in `AndroidManifest.xml`
